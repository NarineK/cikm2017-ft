weak supervision, in which training labels are noisy and may be from
multiple, potentially overlapping sources
To address this, we model the labeling functions as a generative
process, which lets us automatically de-noise the resulting training set by learning the accuracies of
the labeling functions along with their correlation structure. In turn, we use this model of the training
set to optimize a stochastic version of the loss function of the discriminative model that we desire to train.
